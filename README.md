## 3.3 Datasets

The OECD\'s Main Science and Technology Indicators dataset offers key
data on science, technology, innovation, and research for its members
and other economies, covering R&D expenditure, researchers, patents, and
tech exports. It highlights global innovation and tech progress. Gross
domestic spending on R&D (GERD) measures total R&D expenditure within an
economy, with the OECD using GERD as a percentage of GDP to compare R&D
investment across various countries. For analysis in 4.3, we also looked
at datasets from many sources including IMF, World Bank, World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and more.

# 4.0 Analysis

The analysis will synthesize data from the sources mentioned in the
previous section to identify key innovation drivers and measure their
impact.

## 4.1 Youtube Videos

Our analysis began with transcribing six YouTube videos using the
Whisper module, followed by summarizing the transcripts with OpenAI to
identify key insights:

-   *Productivity and Capital Investment*: A significant productivity
    gap exists between Canadian and American workers, attributed to
    lower capital investment, risk-averse culture, and limited
    government support for research and innovation.

-   *Brain Drain*: Canada is experiencing a brain drain, with talented
    individuals moving to the US for better opportunities, higher
    salaries, and more affordable housing.

-   *Housing Affordability*: Recurrent mentions of housing affordability
    issues in Canadian cities highlight their negative impact on the
    economy, business, and talent retention, with high housing prices
    diverting investment from business to housing.

-   *Government Support and Collaboration*: Concerns were noted about
    the inadequate government support for research, academia, business,
    and entrepreneurship.

-   *Investment Imbalance and Short-Term Focus*: An imbalance in private
    investment versus government support for basic research may impair
    long-term innovation and growth, coupled with a prevalent focus on
    short-term gains over transformative projects.

## 4.2 Documents and Reports

A wide range of PDF documents were analyzed with a focus on six key
areas identified through OpenAI: Economic Progress and Competitiveness,
Innovation Definition Expansion, Innovation in Emerging Markets, Private
Sector Involvement, Intellectual Property, and Measurable Innovation.
Using text mining and sentiment analysis, we extracted and evaluated
keywords for each area, assessing the sentiment and focus of various
countries.

Our analysis revealed that Canada\'s innovation strategy lacks emphasis
on Private Sector Involvement, expanding the Innovation Definition, and
Measurable Innovation. This gap suggests the need for policy adjustments
and strategic improvements. Canada could strengthen its innovation
ecosystem by increasing private sector engagement, broadening the
innovation concept, and establishing clear, measurable goals. See the
results summarized in Figure 1 and 2 which show the areas ranked by each
category from most positive sentiment (1) to least (6) for each country.

## 4.3 Datasets

Further analysis was conducted, leveraging diverse datasets and detailed
metrics. This analysis was enriched through the utilization of PDF
document analysis facilitated by the OpenAI API. The focus of this
examination centers on the following key areas, aiming to systematically
score and rank the countries under review, including Canada, based on
their performance and initiatives:

# 5.0 Proposal for Canada's Innovation Ecosystem Development Strategy

***The story***

In this section, we\'ll analyze Canada\'s innovation ecosystem,
examining challenges such as labor productivity, investment levels, and
entrepreneurship. We\'ll emphasize the need for a comprehensive strategy
to increase the budget for business R&D to catch up to other nations.
This narrative aims to outline key steps for strengthening Canada\'s
innovation ecosystem and ensuring its long-term prosperity.

Canada has a productivity issue. Canada\'s labor productivity is
currently lower than most developed nations, including those that lead
in innovation ranking. This is measured by the value an economy produces
for every hour worked and the growth rate of that productivity. Since
1984, Canada\'s productivity has been on a decline, falling from 88% of
the value generated by the US economy per hour to just 71% in 2022
\[12\]. This decline is also evident when compared to other G7 peers,
with only Italy experiencing a larger decline in productivity relative
to the United States.

Simultaneously, Canada has seen a significant increase in compensation
per hour worked, particularly in the public sector. This increase in
public sector investment, however, has not resulted in a corresponding
increase in productivity. Instead, it has coincided with a sharp decline
in worker productivity, leading to high compensations per hour worked
but little to show for it. The increase in public sector spending can
also be seen in that over 300 thousand public sector employees are
making over \$100000 CAD annually, and the number of public sector
employees who surpass the threshold has increased exponentially over the
past two decades, from 34000 in 2006 to 300000 in 2024 \[Appendix A\].

In previous sections, we showed that the data collected from our sources
indicated a negative sentiment around private sector investment, which
is a key driver of innovation. This sentiment is supported by the 2023
report using OECD statistics, which shows that private business
investment per employment in Canada is among the lowest in OECD
countries.

![](media/image7.png){width="4.451087051618548in"
height="1.640625546806649in"}

**Figure 5**

Furthermore, Canada's Business Enterprise Expenditure on R&D (BERD) as a
percentage of GDP has been on a steady decline since 2000, in stark
contrast to the rising investment seen among OECD nations on average. In
2021, Canada ranked 21st in BERD as a % of GDP, allocating only 0.93%,
significantly lower than the OECD average of 1.99%. [This shortfall
equates to a substantial \$27 billion gap in R&D investment]{.mark}
\[Figure 5\][.]{.mark} This trend continued in 2022, with Canada's BERD
falling even further to 0.86% \[13\].

![](media/image8.png){width="4.725in" height="2.75in"}

**Figure 7**

The OECD sub-categorizes GERD between business and government-financed
operations. Among the top 15 nations ranked in the 2023 GII report,
Canada has placed last in its ratio of business to government financed
operations as a percentage of GDP between 2019 and 2021.

This decline in private sector investment and increase in public sector
investment has led to a decrease in the number of entrepreneurs in
Canada, despite the fact that start-ups are a key to innovation. Perhaps
a byproduct of low private sector involvement - Canada has less
entrepreneurs today than it did 20 years ago \[14\]. Start-ups are shown
to drive innovation in a country as they create new and disruptive tech.
This is concerning as Canada\'s standard of living has also fallen from
6th out of 20 countries in 1981 to 12th in 2021, and if this trend
continues, it is projected to fall to 14th place by 2060 \[13\].

When given the chance, the private sector shows that it has great
potential to innovate, and has great strengths in certain areas. In the
pharmaceutical and IT sectors, we see allocations of 14.2% and 29.89% of
total R&D spending, respectively \[Appendix B\]\[13\]. The
telecommunication services sector also contributes significantly to R&D,
accounting for 15.25%. This proves that if given the resources, the
private sector has the means, incentives, and agility to invest in
research and development, adopt new technologies, and implement more
efficient business practices. Private sector investment can foster the
development of an innovation ecosystem, where startups, small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), and large corporations collaborate and compete to
bring new ideas to market.

Investment in the private sector can also enable businesses to adopt new
technologies and processes that enhance productivity, such as
automation, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and advanced
manufacturing techniques.

One of the biggest obstacles to innovation is the apparent lack of
skills in Canadian workers. Investment in education, training, and skill
development programs can help build a workforce that is better equipped
to innovate and adapt to technological advancements. Canada has admitted
to severe short falls in worker skills. According to a report by
StatCan, more than half (56.1 per cent) of Canadian businesses in 2021
said that their current workforce was not fully proficient to perform
jobs at the required level \[15\]. By investing in human capital,
businesses can improve their competitiveness and drive productivity
gains.

Therefore, it is crucial to implement policies and initiatives that
encourage entrepreneurship, stimulate investment, and create a conducive
environment for businesses to thrive in Canada. We propose that Canada
allocate \$27 Billion in their next budget to address the shortfall in
BERD as a % of GDP. The following section will outline how the funds in
this budget should be allocated.

# 6.0 Practical Steps For Implementing The Strategy

Despite Canada\'s existing efforts with policies like the Innovation and
Skills Plan, the country continues to face challenges in boosting its
innovation landscape. A key strategy has been the deployment of tax
incentives, particularly through the Scientific Research and
Experimental Development (SR&ED) program \[16\], aimed at enhancing
Business Expenditure on Research and Development (BERD). However, these
initiatives are relatively new, and their full impact as catalysts for
innovation is still unfolding. As mentioned, we propose a \$27 Billion
budget to close the BERD spending gap. These funds will be allocated in
the following 3 categories:

\$9 Billion - *Improve Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)*

To foster innovation through Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), Canada
can model global successes to develop a cohesive strategy that includes
secure data exchange, digital identities, and smart infrastructure.
Emulating Estonia\'s X-Road \[17\] could enhance interactions between
government and the private sector, while a digital ID system, similar to
India's Aadhaar, would simplify access to services and improve
efficiency in finance and healthcare. Adopting principles of open
banking, as seen in the UK \[18\], can revolutionize financial services,
promoting entrepreneurship by offering startups easier access to
financial data and services. Additionally, by investing in smart
infrastructure, akin to Singapore's Smart Nation \[19\], Canada can
stimulate cross-sectoral innovation, driving research and development
and fostering a conducive environment for entrepreneurial growth.

\$9 Billion - *Enhance Intellectual Property (IP) protection*

To boost its appeal for business R&D, Canada could enhance its IP
enforcement by establishing specialized courts, similar to
Switzerland\'s model \[20\]. This system ensures expert adjudication of
IP disputes, leading to predictable, efficient outcomes. Such a move
would secure Canada\'s IP environment, particularly benefiting
rapid-innovation sectors like biotech and digital tech. Specialized IP
courts would improve Canada\'s global reputation as a secure hub for R&D
investment, signaling a strong commitment to protecting innovations and
driving technological progress.

\$9 Billion - *Promote academic-industry research collaboration*

In Canada, innovation intermediaries like the MaRS Discovery District
significantly enhance the innovation ecosystem by facilitating essential
collaborations between academic institutions and businesses. As
knowledge brokers, they streamline the innovation process and support
the journey from idea to market. Introducing additional, sector-specific
intermediaries could further tighten the academia-industry nexus,
addressing unique challenges across diverse sectors. For example, in
Germany, the Fraunhofer Society operates as a model for sector-specific
intermediaries, successfully linking research with industry needs across
various fields, from energy to healthcare, thus bolstering Germany\'s
innovation capacity.

# 7.0 Conclusion

In conclusion, this report underscores the urgent need for a
comprehensive strategy to rejuvenate Canada\'s innovation ecosystem.
With a \$27 billion allocation, the strategy focuses on enhancing
digital infrastructure, intellectual property protection, and
academic-industry collaboration. By drawing inspiration from global
successes like Estonia\'s X-Road and Switzerland\'s IP courts, and by
investing in organizations such as the MaRS Discovery District, the aim
is to foster cross-sector innovation, safeguard intellectual property,
and nurture essential partnerships between academia and industry.

Our analysis reveals concerning trends, including declining
productivity, insufficient private sector investment, and a growing
reliance on public sector spending. These factors have adversely
affected Canada\'s innovation ranking and global competitiveness.
Addressing skill shortages, reducing regulatory barriers, and supporting
risk mitigation are essential steps to create an environment where
businesses can flourish and compete effectively on the global stage.

The proposed strategic changes are poised to stimulate private sector
investment, promote entrepreneurship, and cultivate an innovation
ecosystem conducive to collaborative competition in bringing new ideas
to market. These initiatives not only address current deficiencies but
also position Canada as a frontrunner in the global innovation
landscape.

The successful implementation of this strategy will require a collective
effort from the government, industry, and academia. By working together,
these stakeholders can secure Canada\'s position as a global leader in
innovation, driving economic growth and improving the standard of living
for all Canadians. The journey towards a more innovative Canada is
challenging, but with strategic planning and concerted effort, it is a
goal well within reach.
